# VtMBFontEditor

With this tool it is possible to view and edit the fonts of the game Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines.  

To view the fonts, you must have exported the fonts to .TGA format (.tth/.ttz files). Regarding editing, it is possible to edit the .FNT files of these fonts, at least in certain aspects.  

You CAN NOT edit the image files (you can use any other tool for do that, like Photoshop or Gimp), but this tool needs the images in .TGA format specifically. To export the images to .TGA format, you can do that with Bloodlines SDK. There are tools specific for this.  

The tool is very simple:

Here you can see the characters of the font at the left.  
At the right you have the list of characters that the font uses (Windows-1252), and you can edit the "Char Values" and "Char Coordinates".  
Once edited, if you want to save them, you have to push "Update Values" or "Update Coordinates" buttons. Then "Save" or "Save As..." the font.  
This is only a test tool, and I have not discovered what do all the values. You will have to play with them yourself.
